# Solution 30 of 45

**Task:** Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
- If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
- Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

**Solution:**
- Create an array *'username'* with 5 values.
- Create an if statement to check if the username is admin.
- Log the appropriate message.
