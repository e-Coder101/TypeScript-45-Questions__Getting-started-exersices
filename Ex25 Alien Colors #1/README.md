# Solution 25 of 45

**Task:** Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
- Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print
a message that the player just earned 5 points.
- Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

**Solution:**
- Create two TS file; *app1* and *app2* (or anything you like).
- Declare the variable *alien_color* in both files.
- In the first file, assign the value **"green"** to the variable.
- In the second file, assign the value **"yellow"** or **"red"** to the variable.
- Create a function in another file that checks if the value of the *alien_color* is **"green"**.
- Export the function to that it could be used in the *app1* and *app2* files.
