# Solution 26 of 45

**Task:** Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and
write an if-else chain.
- If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
- If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
- Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

**Solution:**
- Copy all TS files from Ex 25.
- Modify the funtion that checks if the value of *alien_color* is **"green"**.
- Create a statement inside both if and else block, rewarding 5 or 10 points accordingly.
- Export the function to that it could be used in the *app1* and *app2* files.
