# Solution 3 of 45

**Task:** Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

**Solution:** 
- Create a variable *'personName'* in mixed case.
- log the variable in lowercase using **toLowerCase()**.
- log the variable in uppercase using **toUpperCase()**.
- log the variable in titlecase by creating a function that takes a string, divides its words into an array, capitalizes the first character of each word, then joins the array back into a string and returns it.
