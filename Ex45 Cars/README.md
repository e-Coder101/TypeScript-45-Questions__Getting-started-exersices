# Solution 45 of 45

**Task:** Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

**Solution:**
- Create an object type *'Car'* and give it the required properties *'manufacturer'* & *'modelName'*; and optional properties *'color'*, *'isManual'*, *'drivenMileage'* and *'modifications'*.
- Create a function with the same required and optional parameters as the *Car* object.
- Retun the object and print it.
